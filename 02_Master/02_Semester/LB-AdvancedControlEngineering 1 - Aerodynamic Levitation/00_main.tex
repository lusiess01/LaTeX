% An explanation of how you identified the system and the choices made in this procedure, e.g. height calculation, step response, identified system etc.

%  A description of the observer and the implemented controller including a schematic.
\section{Controller technology} \label{sec:technology}

\newpage

% The performance of the controller in simulation for all reference trajectories: description and plots. You may include multiple controllers if you went through several iterations.
\section{Simulation} \label{sec:simulation}
\input{04_simulation}

\newpage

% A short interpretation and discussion of the performance above. Try to explain for which regimes the controller works well (or poorly) and why.
\section{Results and interpretation} \label{sec:results}

\newpage

% The performance of the controller on the plant for the different reference trajectories.

% Again, a short interpretation and discussion of the performance above. Try to explain for which regimes the controller works well (or poorly) and why.
